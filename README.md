Check Room Status: Find out if a specific room is booked or available.
Cancel Booking: Remove a reservation from the system.
Show All Rooms: Display a list of all rooms in the hotel.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java (JDBC for database connectivity)
Database: MySQL
IDE: Eclipse 
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Database Structure:
The MySQL database includes tables such as:
Customers: Stores customer information (name, contact number, etc.).
Rooms: Stores room details (room number, category, price, availability).
Reservations: Stores booking details (customer ID, room number, check-in and check-out dates).
How It Works:
Users interact with a console-based menu.
The system connects to the MySQL database to store and retrieve reservation details.
Database operations are performed using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
